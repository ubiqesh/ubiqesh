yagni
=====

yagni is an easy to use machine to machine communication (private and public) cloud solution. Core features are:

1. **Real** machine to machine communication i.e. no restriction from where or how a device is connected to the cloud - it can talk to your other devices.
2. Integrates/Provides an API for simple inter-device **actions** (maybe [ifttt.com](http://ifttt.com))
3. Give you the ability to **share** your devices with all members of the YAGNI-community.
4. Provides some standard drivers and an API to create custom ones so that you can get your machines to talk to each other **without** writing a single line of **code**.


***
Private cloud: In a first step this will be one raspberry pi device (later we want to support also a mesh of devices and a seamless integration in the public device-cloud).
