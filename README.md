2. Integrates/Provides an API for simple inter-device **actions** (maybe [ifttt.com](http://ifttt.com))
3. Give you the ability to **share** your devices with all members of the UBIQESH-community.
4. Provides some standard drivers and an API to create custom ones so that you can get your machines to talk to each other **without** writing a single line of **code**.
